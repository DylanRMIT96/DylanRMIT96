This is Chenyu Wu, and DylanRMIT96 is my nickname in GitHub.
I am graduated from RMIT with master degree, and I am specialized in IT.
I am currently learning the tech about Cpp, cause I am a Cpp engineer now.
However, I am still a rookie in this area.
To improve my personal skill in programming, I join the GitHub community to search some help for my future.
I will keep passion in my job and be feel energetic in anything related to code.

Make everyday count!
cheers man!
